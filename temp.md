**Execute Phase 1: Data Loading and Exploration**
   - **Data Loading**: Import and examine the raw dataset
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand data distributions and relationships
   
   **📁 Key File:** `data_cleaning_and_feature_engineering.ipynb`
   - This is your main working file containing the complete ML pipeline
   - Follow each section carefully to understand the data science workflow
   - Execute cells step by step to see immediate results

   **💡 What you're learning:**
   - How to identify and handle missing data
   - Understanding feature distributions and correlations
   - Identifying outliers and anomalies in the dataset

4. **Execute Phase 2: Data Cleaning**
   - **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies
   - **Feature Engineering**: Create new features and transform existing ones
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare data for machine learning

   **💡 What you're learning:**
   - Feature scaling and normalization techniques
   - Creating meaningful features from raw data
   - Dealing with categorical variables (encoding techniques)
   - Data transformation strategies

   **✅ Checkpoint:** After this step, you should have:
   - Clean training and test datasets
   - New engineered features
   - Processed data saved as `new_train.csv` and `new_test.csv`

### Step 5: Model Development and Training

**🎯 Project Status:** Model Building (Phase 2 of 4)

5. **Execute Phase 3: Baseline Model Training**
   - Train a Linear Regression model as a starting point
   - Understand the training process and evaluation metrics

   **💡 Model Evaluation Metrics:**
   - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average absolute difference between predictions and actual values
   - **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Average squared difference (penalizes larger errors)
   - **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Square root of MSE (same units as target)

6. **Execute Phase 4: Advanced Models (Optional)**
   - Experiment with XGBoost for better performance
   - Compare different algorithms and their results

   **✅ Checkpoint:** After this step, you should have:
   - A trained Linear Regression model saved as `linear_regression_model.pkl`
   - Model performance metrics documented
   - Understanding of different algorithm performances

### Step 6: Results Analysis and Improvement

**🎯 Project Status:** Analysis and Optimization (Phase 4 of 4)

9. **Interpret Model Performance**
   - Compare different models using the evaluation metrics
   - Understand why certain models perform better
   - Analyze feature importance and model explanations

10. **Application Feature Testing**
    
    **📊 Available Features:**
    - **House Price Prediction Interface**: Input property characteristics using intuitive sliders and dropdowns
    - **Custom Model Training**: Upload your own datasets and train models with different algorithms
    - **Model Comparison**: Compare Linear Regression vs XGBoost performance and view detailed evaluation metrics

11. **Identify Improvement Opportunities**
    - Feature engineering ideas for better performance
    - Hyperparameter tuning suggestions
    - Alternative modeling approaches to explore
