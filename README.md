# 📊 Project Title: *Advanced House Prices Prediction*

## 🏠 Overview

The dataset belongs to a never ending competition leaderboard on kaggle where the best score 0.00000, 0.00003 and 0.00044 of Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE). [For More Info.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview)

This project predicts house prices using the Ames Housing dataset, showcasing a complete machine learning workflow:

- 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:** Raw data is preprocessed and transformed for optimal model performance.
- 🤖 **Model Training:** A linear regression model is trained on the engineered features. Users can also train custom regression models directly within the Streamlit app using their own data.
- 🚀 **Deployment:** The Streamlit web app provides an interactive UI for predictions, custom model training, and basic analysis of results.
- 📊 **Analysis:** The app displays key evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE) and visualizations to help interpret model performance.

The pipeline is designed for reproducibility and flexibility in advanced regression tasks.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide

### 🏆 Kaggle Setup

To use Kaggle datasets or APIs, you need to set up your Kaggle credentials:

1. 🔗 Go to your Kaggle account settings: [https://www.kaggle.com/account](https://www.kaggle.com/account).
2. 🛡️ Scroll down to the **API** section and click **Create New API Token**.
3. 📥 This will download a file named `kaggle.json`.
4. 📂 Place `kaggle.json` in the folder:  
    - 🐧 **Linux/macOS:** `~/.kaggle/` or sometimes in `~/.config/kaggle/kaggle.json`
    - 🪟 **Windows:** `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.kaggle\`
5. 🔒 Make sure the file permissions are secure (Linux/macOS):
    ```bash
    chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
    ```
6. In order to be able to download the dataset you must join the competition and [accept the rules.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview)

7. 📦 You can now use the Kaggle CLI to download datasets:
    ```bash
    kaggle competitions download -c house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques -p data/
    ```



### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Open and run `data_cleaning_and_feature_engineering.ipynb` to preprocess and engineer features from the raw data.
- Follow up to train a Linear Regression Model on this difficult case.

### 2️⃣ Train Model (if needed)
- Use scripts or notebook to train and save models in `models/` (default model provided). Note: By running the `data_cleaning_and_feature_engineering.ipynb` notebook, it will train the model and save it automatically.

### 3️⃣ Launch the Streamlit App
- Run the following command or using docker:
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```
- Use the sidebar to select between house price prediction and custom regression modules.
- Train your own model on your own data using the custom regression module.

## 📊 Results

- **Predictions:** 🏡 View predicted house prices in the Streamlit app UI.
- **Model:** 🤖 The trained linear regression model is stored in `models/linear_regression_model.pkl`.
- **Data:** 🗂️ Cleaned datasets are in `data/new_train.csv` and `data/new_test.csv`.
- **Notebook:** 📓 All preprocessing and feature engineering steps are documented in the notebook.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
    - *📉 Mean Absolute Error (MAE):* Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual prices. Lower values indicate better accuracy.
        - **Linear Regression:** 19,452.09
        - **XGBoost:** 16,483.55 (better)
    - *📈 Mean Squared Error (MSE):* Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual prices. It penalizes larger errors more than MAE.
        - **Linear Regression:** 711,102,117.35
        - **XGBoost:** 578,007,680.00 (lower is better)
    - *📊 Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):* Represents the square root of MSE, providing error in the same units as the target variable. RMSE is sensitive to large errors (outliers) because it squares the differences.
        - **Linear Regression:** 26,666.50
        - **XGBoost:** 24,041.79 (lower is better)

    > **Interpretation:**  
    XGBoost outperforms Linear Regression on MAE, MSE, and RMSE, indicating more accurate and robust predictions for house prices.
